The downloaded file is a zip archive. We found this out by using the file command.
Unzip the file with unzip. In it you find a ntfs file system which we can mount with:

mkdir /mnt/directory
mount -t ntfs family.ntfs /mnt/directory

Upon navigating to /mnt/directory you can see that it is a Windows Filesystem. The interesting file is /Users/Documents/credentials.txt 
Reading the content of the file you get a hint that the author likes to hide her credentials as image files inside extended attributes. 

You can read extended attributes with this command: 
getfattr -d -m ".*" credentials.txt

The output of the above command looks like the following:
"user.FILE0=0si.........." (without the quotes)

This is a base64 encoded image. I removed everything up to the first "s" character and then saved the file. Then I used the following command to decode it to an image:
cat saved_file | base64 -d > image.png

Opening the png image showed the flag
